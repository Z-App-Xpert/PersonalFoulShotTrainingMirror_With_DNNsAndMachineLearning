# PersonalFoulShotTrainingMirror_With_DNNsAndMachineLearning
- This repository holds the classical programming site developed in Chapter VIII - Commonsense Baseline, for iteration two during the development of the Foul Shot Training Mirror. This approach is part of 'The Universal Workflow of Machine Learning' and the purpose is to see if a Deep Learning model, developed in iteration three, will begin to outperform this commonsense approach.  
- ‘8_11_Data.csv’ resides here.  This data is used to train initial RNN models.
